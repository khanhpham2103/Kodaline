# Kodaline website
## Descriptions
This is my first website using **HTML, CSS** (and few **JavaScripts**) about an Irish band called Kodaline
This website is based on a website called "The Band" by W3Schools
Made by following the tutorial on fullstack.edu.vn (F8) with some of my modifications
## Languages have been used
HTML, CSS (and few JavaScripts)
## Main functions
Nothing but the very first step in **designing** and **cloning** website \n
So, the function will not be available
## Deployment
